        "Description:\n",
        "This script implements the Data Encryption Standard (DES) algorithm for encryption and decryption. DES is a symmetric key algorithm that uses a 56-bit key to encrypt and decrypt data in 64-bit blocks. The algorithm involves several steps including initial and final permutations, key generation, and multiple rounds of substitution and permutation.\n",
